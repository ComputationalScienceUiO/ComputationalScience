TITLE: Master program in Computational Science  at the University of Oslo
AUTHOR: Why choose this program
DATE: Planned start: Fall 2018




===== Why choose this program =====

The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. 

It is the first educational program to
comprehensively treat computation as the *triple junction* of
algorithm development and analysis, high performance computing, and
applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data
science. This approach recognizes computation as a new discipline
rather than being decentralized into isolated sub-disciplines.

=== Scientific Computing, a new Master of Science program  ===



Scientific computing focuses on the development of predictive computer
models of the world around us. As studies of physical phenomena through
experimentation have become almost impossible, impractical and/or expensive,
computational modeling has become the primary tool for
understanding, equal in stature to analysis and experiment. 
The discipline of scientific computing
is the development of new methods that make challenging problems
tractable on modern computing platforms, providing scientists and
engineers with key windows into the world around us.

Data science focuses on the development of tools designed to find
trends within datasets that help scientists who are challenged with
massive amounts of data to assess key relations within those
datasets. These key relations provide hooks that allow scientists to
identify models which, in turn, facilitate making accurate predictions
in complex systems. For example, a key data science goal on the
biological side would be better care for patients (e.g., personalized
medicine). Given a patientâ€™s genetic makeup, the proper data-driven
model would identify the most effective treatment for that patient.

An important  aim of this program is to develop your abilities to pose and
solve problems that combine  insights from one or more disciplines from the natural sciences 
with mathematical tools and computational skills. This provides a unique combination
of applied and theoretical knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable
for the development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.
The main focus is not to educate computer
specialists, but to give you an education  with a solid understanding in basic science
as well as an integrated knowledge on how  to use
essential methods from computational science. This requires an
education that covers both the  specific disciplines like physics, biology,
geoscience, mathematics etc with a strong background in computational science.
This Master of Science program is unique in the sense that it will enable application-driven computational modeling
while also exposing disciplinary computational scientists to
advanced tools and techniques. This will hopefully  ignite new
transformational connections in research and education.

* "Computational Science: Mechanics":"https://computationalscienceuio.github.io/ComputationalScience/doc/pub/CompMech/html/CompMech-bs.html": This study option includes both fluid and solid mechanics with a common base of continuum mechanics and gives you the tools to solve important problems in basic and applied research. 
* "Computational Science: Physics":"https://computationalscienceuio.github.io/ComputationalScience/doc/pub/CompPhys/html/CompPhys-bs.html": Here you will find an extensive spectrum  of possibilities, ranging from studying quantum physical systems in nanotechnology, via subatomic physics including lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations and studies of stars and the synthesis of the elements, to oil flow through various rock strata, simulating natural disasters, computational statistical physics, plasma physics, semi-conductor technology and ow to understand  quantum computers and quantum computing.




=== Study environment ===

This is new program at the University of Oslo and through various activities, spanning from common meetings and field trips to various social gatherings, we will gradually build up a top learning  environment where you will thrive as a student and learn to develop your scientific creativity. The University of Oslo offers  a rich and active student environment with more than 200 student lead activities and organizations. 

=== Studies abroad ===

All study options offer possibilities for stays abroad. Planning a
semester or more abroad or performing parts of your thesis at a
collaborating institution is something we highly recommend. As a
student in this program you have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibility range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA. Don't hesitate to
get in touch with  the contact person of your study option in case you plan to
spend some time abroad. Studies at other
institutions can be planned from the very first semester of this
Master of Science program.

Students at the University of Oslo may choose to "take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/".
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. "The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/".


=== Career prospect ===

A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling. And candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems that you will learn
when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods
you  will use in later stages of your career.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
