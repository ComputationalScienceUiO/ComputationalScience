===== Why choose this program =====

The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges. 

It is the first educational program to
comprehensively treat computation as the *triple junction* of
algorithm development and analysis, high performance computing, and
applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data
science. This approach recognizes computation as a new discipline
rather than being decentralized into isolated sub-disciplines.

=====  Why Computational Science in four points =====

* This program aims at educating the next generation of cross-disciplinary science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal challenges. 

* Complex systems involving many scales pose a great challenge to our present understanding of problems in Science. This program allows you explore the theory needed to understand complex systems with the tools of the 21st century.

* All disciplines in the Sciences are represented in this program and you can thereby explore and design thesis projects that cover a large range of topics and own interests, from Mathematics and Computational Science to the Physical Sciences and Life Sciences.    

* Combining machine learning and data analysis with quantum computing is an exciting topic which can change totally the future of computer simulations and the way we study physical systems.
