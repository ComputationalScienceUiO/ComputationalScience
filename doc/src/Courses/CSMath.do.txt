TITLE: Mathematical modeling in Science
AUTHOR: Departmement of Mathematics, University of Oslo
DATE: Planned start: Fall semester 2018


===== Mathematical modeling in Science: a new 10-ECTS course for both CS students and others =====


Pre-requirement: basic knowledge in programming & numerics. Required courses are the equivalents to the University of Oslo mathematics courses MAT1100, MAT1110, MAT1120 and at least one of the corresponding computing and programming courses INF1000/INF1110 or MAT-INF1100/MAT-INF1100L/BIOS1100/KJM-INF1xxx. 


=== Learning outcomes ===


===== The course has  =====



Computational aspects play a central role and the students are expected to work on numerical projects which illustrate the theory. Some of the projects can be coordinated with the high-performance programming course (course code to be added). 

=== Statistical analysis and optimization of data ===

The following topics will be covered


All topics will be supported by examples, hands-on exercises and project work.
===  Machine learning ===



All topics will be supported by examples, hands-on exercises and project work.


=== Practicalities ===

o Four lectures per week, Fall semester, 10 ECTS
o Four hours of laboratory sessions for work on computational projects
o Three projects which are graded and count 60% of the final grade
o A selected number of weekly assignments which count  10% of the final grade
o Final written exam which counts 30% of the final grade
o Organized by the Department of Mathematics
o Possible teachers first time: XXX
o The course is part of the CS Master of Science program, but is open to other bachelor and Master of Science students at the University of Oslo. 
o Grading scale: Grades are awarded on a scale from A to F, where A is the best grade and F is a fail
o The course will be offered as a 4XXX and 3XXX course.
