===== Structure and courses =====

The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.

The program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.

===== New courses  =====

In order to build a common study program and identity as a Computational Science student, there will be two compulsory courses that aim at providing topics of common and broad interest.
Both courses have a workload of 10 ECTS each. The courses are

* _CS-MATH1_: *Data analysis and machine learning*, 10 ECTS (Existing "STK2100":"http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/STK2100/", "GEO4310":"http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/geofag/GEO4310/")

  o Monte Carlo methods and statistical data analysis
  o Optimization of data and handling of large data sets
  o Machine learning and neural networks
* _CS-INF1_: *High-Performance Computing and Numerical projects*, 10 ECTS (Existing INF3380)
  o This course teaches you to develop and structure large numerical projects, from code writing to  finalizing a report
  o Topics which are included are parallelization and vectorization
  o Machine architecture and GPU-CPU programming
  o Optimization of code and benchmarking
  o Numerical methods from linear algebra will be discussed as well as examples from life science.





===== Possible new courses =====
Some of these courses could incorporate (or base themselves upon) existing ones. The courses here are organized according to their corresponding disciplines. They should, for search ease, contain the word _Computational_
