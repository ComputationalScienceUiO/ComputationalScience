===== Why Computational Physics =====


Many important recent advances in
our understanding of the physical world have been driven by
large-scale computational modeling and data analysis, for example,
the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, the 2013 Nobel Prize in
chemistry for computational modeling of molecules (received by
biophysicists), and the 2016 discovery of gravitational waves. It has
become clear that a large fraction of theoretical and experimental
physicists require a high level of computational sophistication to
competently pursue many aspects of their work, a trend that is likely
to grow with time as computers increase in power and experimental
datasets grow exponentially. The Computational Physics option will allow you to explore Physics with the tools of the 21st century.


===  The Computational Physics study option ===


In Computational Physics you learn to use the computer as a
laboratory for solving advanced  physics problems. 
Numerical simulations will increasingly dominate our approaches to studying physical
systems, in line with the increase in computational capabilities.
Possible applications range from studying
quantum physical systems in nanotechnology and the characteristics of
new materials, subatomic physics, from lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations to studies of stars and the synthesis of the elements, to oil flow through various rock strata, physics applications to life science and computational neuroscience, semi-conductor
technology and simulating quantum computers and quantum computing. Research
includes both pure research projects as well as more applied research.

Other possibilities for thesis work can be related to pedagogical
questions and the use of computing in teaching at the university level. Thesis topics can span from
developing numerical exercises and projects for university or college courses to the development and participation in advanced  assessment studies.




=== Study environment ===

This is new program at the University of Oslo and through various
activities, spanning from common meetings and field trips to various
social gatherings, we will gradually build up a top learning
environment where you will thrive as a student and learn to develop
your scientific creativity. The University of Oslo offers a rich and
active student environment with more than 200 student led activities
and organizations.

=== Studies abroad ===

All study options offer possibilities for stays abroad. Planning a
semester or more abroad or performing parts of your thesis at a
collaborating institution is something we highly recommend. As a
student in this program you have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibilities range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA. Don't hesitate to
get in touch with  the contact person of your study option in case you plan to
spend some time abroad. Studies at other
institutions can be planned from the very first semester of this
Master of Science program.

Students at the University of Oslo may choose to "take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/".
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. "The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/".


=== Career prospect ===

A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling. And candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems that you will learn
when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods
you  will use in later stages of your career.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes you unique in the labor market.

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
