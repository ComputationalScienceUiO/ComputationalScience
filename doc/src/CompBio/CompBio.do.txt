===== Why Computational Bioscience =====

Do you want to understand how our brain functions in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system? Or do you want  to gain proficiency in computational tools and techniques that are unsed in  the life sciences? Computational Bioscience prepares you for the discovery and implementation of algorithms that facilitate our understanding of biological processes.



===  The Computational Bioscience study option ===

Just as the invention of the microscope allowed biologists to see
patterns invisible to the naked eye, computational science allows
biologists to study patterns and processes in data sets too large or
complex to be studied with the classical observational
techniques. Such data sets are encountered in all branches of modern
biosciences, from those studying how genomes determine the development
and function of organisms, to those investigating how climate and
landscape structures on different scales determine the productivity
and biodiversity of our planet. On the other hand, meeting the
challenges of biological data also requires development of new
theories and computational tools. With a Master's degree in CS:
Biosciences you will work with cutting-edge scientists exploring the
convergence of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computational
science.

=== Study environment ===

This is new program at the University of Oslo and through various activities, spanning from common meetings and field trips to various social gatherings, we will gradually build up a top learning  environment where you will thrive as a student and learn to develop your scientific creativity. The University of Oslo offers  a rich and active student environment with more than 200 student lead activities and organizations. 

=== Studies abroad ===

All study options offer possibilities for stays abroad. Planning a
semester or more abroad or performing parts of your thesis at a
collaborating institution is something we highly recommend. As a
student in this program you have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibility range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA. Don't hesitate to
get in touch with  the contact person of your study option in case you plan to
spend some time abroad. Studies at other
institutions can be planned from the very first semester of this
Master of Science program.

Students at the University of Oslo may choose to "take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/".
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. "The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/".


=== Career prospect ===

A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling. And candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems that you will learn
when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods
you  will use in later stages of your career.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
