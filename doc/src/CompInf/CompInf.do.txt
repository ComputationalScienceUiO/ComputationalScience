===== Why Imaging and Biomedical Computing =====

Advanced image analysis and computational tools are increasingly
important across many areas of modern society. Over the last few decades these tools have
revolutionized advanced healthcare, have been extremely important in
large industries such as the petroleum sector, and form key parts of
emerging technologies such as autonomus vehicles. All these results
are rooted in fundamental knowledge of computer science and
computational mathematics.  

===  The Computational Imaging and Biomedical Computing Study Option ===

A Master's degree in Imaging and Biomedical Computing will give you a
solid background and deep insight into the technology that underlies modern modern imaging 
and simulation tools. You  will get an excellent
foundation in mathematics and computing, with both being applicable across
many branches of science and engineering.

The direction will have two separate but tightly connected
branches. One is primarily focused on image
analysis, image classification and signal processing, using a range of
computational and mathematical tools.

The other branch of the study direction is focused on 
computational modeling of physical processes, 
with a particular focus on biomedical applications. Computational models
are increasingly important in medical research, and are also making
their way into clinical use. Advanced mathematics and computational
tools are used to build computer simulations of organs
and organ systems, which describe the physiology and function of the
body in health and disease, and may be used for diagnosis and as
virtual test beds for optimizing treatment. Although the main focus
of this branch is on biomedical applications, the underlying tools of
numerical analysis and computational mathematics are generally
applicable, and the candidates are well prepared for tasks in many
areas of science and engineering. 


=== Study environment ===

This is new program at the University of Oslo and through various
activities, spanning from common meetings and field trips to various
social gatherings, we will gradually build up a top learning
environment where you will thrive as a student and learn to develop
your scientific creativity. The University of Oslo offers a rich and
active student environment with more than 200 student led activities
and organizations.

=== Studies abroad ===

All study options offer possibilities for stays abroad. Planning a
semester or more abroad or performing parts of your thesis at a
collaborating institution is something we highly recommend. As a
student in this program you have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibilities range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA. Don't hesitate to
get in touch with  the contact person of your study option in case you plan to
spend some time abroad. Studies at other
institutions can be planned from the very first semester of this
Master of Science program.

Students at the University of Oslo may choose to "take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/".
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. "The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/".


=== Career prospect ===

A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling. And candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems that you will learn
when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods
you  will use in later stages of your career.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes you unique on the labor market.

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
