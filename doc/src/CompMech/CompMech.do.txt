===== Why Computational Mechanics =====



Did you know that the larges waves along the Norwegian coast can be
more than 100 meters high and are located on the interface between
light and heavy water far below the sea surface? How much damage can a
flood wave - tsunami - cause along the coast? Can gigantic waves in
the ocean explain mysterious shipwrecks? Are you interested in safety
or the environment for ships and oil platforms in stormy or arctic
environments?  Do you wish to work with industrial flow problems such
as simultaneous transport of oil and gas in the same pipeline, so-called 
multiphase flow?  Or do you want to learn about how biomechanics is
used to understand the mechanisms behind heart failure, strokes or
AlzheimerÂ´s disease.

===  The Computational Mechanics study option ===

The Computational Mechanics  study option gives
practical experience with basic scientific methodology and thinking, and it teaches you
how to develop various tools based on mathematics, computer science and
mechanics and to use these tools for solving important problems
within science, industry and society.  Computational 
Mechanics includes both fluid and solid state mechanics with a common basis from continuum mechanics.


=== Study environment ===

This is new program at the University of Oslo and through various
activities, spanning from common meetings and field trips to various
social gatherings, we will gradually build up a top learning
environment where you will thrive as a student and learn to develop
your scientific creativity. The University of Oslo offers a rich and
active student environment with more than 200 student led activities
and organizations.

=== Studies abroad ===

All study options offer possibilities for stays abroad. Planning a
semester or more abroad or performing parts of your thesis at a
collaborating institution is something we highly recommend. As a
student in this program you have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibilities range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA. Don't hesitate to
get in touch with  the contact person of your study option in case you plan to
spend some time abroad. Studies at other
institutions can be planned from the very first semester of this
Master of Science program.

Students at the University of Oslo may choose to "take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/".
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. "The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad":"http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/".


=== Career prospect ===

A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling. And candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems that you will learn
when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods
you  will use in later stages of your career.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes you unique on the labor market.

Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
