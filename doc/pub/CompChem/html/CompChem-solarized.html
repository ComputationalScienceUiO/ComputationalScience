<h2 id="___sec0">Why Chemistry </h2>

<p>
One hundred years after the quantum mechanical revolution, chemistry has reached the level of a mature discipline, where the fundamental equations describing the interactions at the level of chemical bonding and intermolecular forces are in principle known. The grand challenge that we face today is in predicting and controlling with high accuracy the behaviour of chemical systems in the presence of complex interactions (heterogeneous phases, system not in thermodynamic equilibrium, interactions with strong electromagnetic fields, etc).&#160;

<p>
This is where computational modeling enters in the game &#8211; by taking this study direction, you will learn to develop and apply a variety of tools that allow you to describe chemical processes at different resolution scales: from solving very accurate quantum mechanical and electronic structure problems, through modeling chemical reactions in the gas phase as well as in solution, to modeling soft-matter and biological systems like proteins, DNA, and so on.
Both software development and the constant growth of massive parallel architectures allow us to overcome the heavy computational costs in simulations of molecular systems. Graphical user interfaces are also important tools used today in modeling chemistry&#160;

<p>
In addition to the general skills acquired in the Master in Computational Science, here we note that computer modeling is today a standard tool used in several chemistry labs both in research and industry &#8212; for example, drug development research and development units use computer modeling to optimize leads prior to their synthesis, which will make the profile of the graduate students very appealing in the job market.

<h2 id="___sec1">Structure and courses </h2>

<p>
The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.

<p>
This  program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.

<h3 id="___sec2">Courses </h3>

Depending on specialization, the following courses that can be included as part of the compulsory 60 ECTS needed for a Master of Science degree are <a href="https://computationalscienceuio.github.io/ComputationalScience/doc/pub/ProgramStructure/html/ProgramStructure-bs.html" target="_blank">described here</a>.

<p>
Students have to choose among two of the following courses

<ol>
<li> CS-MATH1 (data analysis and machine learning)</li>
<li> CS-MATH2 (mathematical modeling)</li>

<h2 id="___sec5">Description of learning outcomes </h2>

<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

The learning outcomes are subdivided in three general categories, knowledge, skills and general competence.

<h2 id="___sec7">Study abroad and international collaborators </h2>

<p>
Students at the University of Oslo may choose to <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/" target="_blank">take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad</a>.
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/" target="_blank">The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad</a>.

<p>
Students in this program have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with: <b>add text</b>

<h2 id="___sec8">Career prospects </h2>

<p>
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

<p>
Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

<p>
The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
