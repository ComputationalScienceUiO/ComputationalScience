<h2 id="___sec0" class="anchor">Why choose this program </h2>

<p>
The program will educate the next generation of cross-disciplinary
science students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to pose
and solve current and new scientific, technological and societal
challenges.

<p>
It is the first educational program to
comprehensively treat computation as the <em>triple junction</em> of
algorithm development and analysis, high performance computing, and
applications to scientific and engineering modeling and data
science. This approach recognizes computation as a new discipline
rather than being decentralized into isolated sub-disciplines.

<h3 id="___sec1" class="anchor">Scientific Computing, a new Master of Science program  </h3>

<p>
Scientific computing focuses on the development of predictive computer
models of the world around us. As studies of physical phenomena through
experimentation have become almost impossible, impractical and/or expensive,
computational modeling has become the primary tool for
understanding, equal in stature to analysis and experiment. 
The discipline of scientific computing
is the development of new methods that make challenging problems
tractable on modern computing platforms, providing scientists and
engineers with key windows into the world around us.

<p>
Data science focuses on the development of tools designed to find
trends within datasets that help scientists who are challenged with
massive amounts of data to assess key relations within those
datasets. These key relations provide hooks that allow scientists to
identify models which, in turn, facilitate making accurate predictions
in complex systems. For example, a key data science goal on the
biological side would be better care for patients (e.g., personalized
medicine). Given a patient&#8217;s genetic makeup, the proper data-driven
model would identify the most effective treatment for that patient.

<p>
An important aim of this program is to develop your abilities to pose
and solve problems that combine insights from one or more disciplines
from the natural sciences with mathematical tools and computational
skills. This provides a unique combination of applied and theoretical
knowledge and skills. These features are invaluable for the
development of multi-disciplinary educational and research programs.
The main focus is not to educate computer specialists, but to give you
an education with a solid understanding in basic science as well as an
integrated knowledge on how to use essential methods from
computational science. This requires an education that covers both the
specific disciplines like physics, biology, geoscience, mathematics
etc with a strong background in computational science.  This Master of
Science program is unique in the sense that it will enable
application-driven computational modeling while also exposing
disciplinary computational scientists to advanced tools and
techniques. This will hopefully ignite new transformational
connections in research and education.

</ul>

<h3 id="___sec3" class="anchor">Study environment </h3>

<p>
This is new program at the University of Oslo and through various
activities, spanning from common meetings and field trips to various
social gatherings, we will gradually build up a top learning
environment where you will thrive as a student and learn to develop
your scientific creativity. The University of Oslo offers a rich and
active student environment with more than 200 student led activities
and organizations.

<h3 id="___sec4" class="anchor">Studies abroad </h3>

<p>
All study options offer possibilities for stays abroad. Planning a
semester or more abroad or performing parts of your thesis at a
collaborating institution is something we highly recommend. As a
student in this program you have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. The exchange
possibilities range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA. Don't hesitate to
get in touch with  the contact person of your study option in case you plan to
spend some time abroad. Studies at other
institutions can be planned from the very first semester of this
Master of Science program.

<p>
Students at the University of Oslo may choose to <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/" target="_self">take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad</a>.
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/" target="_self">The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad</a>.

<h3 id="___sec5" class="anchor">Career prospect </h3>

<p>
A significant aspect of this program is the ability to offer new educational
opportunities that are aligned with the needs of a 21st century
workforce. Many companies are seeking
individuals who have knowledge of both a specific discipline and
computational modeling. And candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems that you will learn
when working on your thesis project are very similar to the methods
you  will use in later stages of your career.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes you unique in the labor market.

<p>
Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

<p>
The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
