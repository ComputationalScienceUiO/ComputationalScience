<h2 id="___sec0" class="anchor">Why Imaging and Biomedical Computing </h2>
Advanced image analysis and computational tools are increasingly
important across many areas of modern society. Over the last few decades these tools have
revolutionized advanced healthcare, have been extremely important in
large industries such as the petroleum sector, and form key parts of
emerging technologies such as autonomus vehicles. All these results
are rooted in fundamental knowledge of computer science and
computational mathematics.

<p>
A Master's degree in Imaging and Biomedical Computing will give you a
solid background to contribute to this development, by providing a
deep insight into the technology that underlies modern modern imaging 
and simulation tools. The graduated candidates will have a solid
foundation in mathematics and computing, which is applicable across
many branches of science and engineering.

<p>
The direction will have two separate but tightly connected
branches. One is primarily focused on image
analysis, image classification and signal processing, using a range of
computational and mathematical tools (fill in more...)

<p>
The other branch of the study direction is focused on 
computational modeling of physical processes, 
with particular focus on biomedical applications. Computational models
are increasingly important in medical research, and are also making
their way into clinical use. Advanced mathematics and computational
tools are used to build computer simulations of organs
and organ systems, which describe the physiology and function of the
body in health and disease, and may be used for diagnosis and as
virtual test beds for optimizing treatment. Although the main focus
of this branch is on biomedical applications, the underlying tools of
numerical analysis and computational mathematics are generally
applicable, and the candidates are well prepared for tasks in many
areas of science and engineering.

<h2 id="___sec1" class="anchor">Structure and courses </h2>

<p>
This  program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoiding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.

<h3 id="___sec2" class="anchor">Courses </h3>

Depending on specialization, the following courses that can be included as part of the compulsory 60 ECTS needed for a Master of Science degree are <a href="https://computationalscienceuio.github.io/ComputationalScience/doc/pub/ProgramStructure/html/ProgramStructure-bs.html" target="_self">described here</a>.

<h3 id="___sec3" class="anchor">Graduate Certificates  </h3>

The program plans to offer graduate certificates in

<ul>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-MATH  gives a certificate in Computational Mathematics</li>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-PHYS gives a certificate in Computational Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Materials Science  and Geoscience</li>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-BIO gives a certificate in Computational life science.</li> 
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-INF gives a certificate in High-performance computing.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec4" class="anchor">Dual Degrees  </h3>

The program plans to offer dual degrees (more text to come)

<h2 id="___sec5" class="anchor">Description of learning outcomes </h2>
The study direction Imaging and biomedical computing has two main
branches. One is focused on image analysis and one is focused on
computational modeling of biomedical phenomena. Both branches give a
solid foundation of computational mathematics and computer science,
but with slightly different flavours. In addition to the general
learning outcomes for the Computational Science program, the following
outcomes apply to the Imaging and biomedical computing direction.

<ul>

<li> An average mark C (European grading scale) is required for the above-specified 80 ECTS in Informatics/Mathematics/Statistics.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="___sec7" class="anchor">Study abroad and international collaborators </h2>

<p>
Students at the University of Oslo may choose to <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/" target="_self">take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad</a>.
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/" target="_self">The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad</a>.

<p>
Students in this program have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with: University of California San Diego through the
<a href="https://www.simula.no/education/educational-partnerships/suurph-programme" target="_self">Suurph program</a>

<h2 id="___sec8" class="anchor">Career prospects </h2>

<p>
Candidates with solid understanding of complex systems in natural
science are in short supply in society in general, and in particular
in the biomedical field. Career opportunities include hospitals,  become increasingly technologically
advanced, and employ a large number of physicists, mathematicians,
and computer scientists, as well as businesses in the growing
biomedical industry. Candidates from the Imaging and Biomedical
Computing direction will be attractive members in research and
development teams, as well as for advanced analysis in clinical
settings.

<p>
Many of the challenges seen in medical imaging or biomedical computing
are shared with other branches of science and engineering. The strong
and generic background in computational modeling and analysis makes
the candidates attractive across many traditional and emerging
industries in Norway and abroad.
