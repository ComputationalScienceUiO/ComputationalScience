<p>
This  program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.

<h3 id="___sec2">Courses </h3>

Depending on specialization, the following courses that can be included as part of the compulsory 60 ECTS needed for a Master of Science degree are <a href="https://computationalscienceuio.github.io/ComputationalScience/doc/pub/ProgramStructure/html/ProgramStructure-bs.html" target="_blank">described here</a>.

<h3 id="___sec3">Graduate Certificates  </h3>

The program plans to offer graduate certificates in

<ul>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-MATH  gives a certificate in Computational Mathematics</li>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-PHYS gives a certificate in Computational Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Materials Science  and Geoscience</li>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-BIO gives a certificate in Computational life science.</li> 
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-INF gives a certificate in High-performance computing.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec4">Dual Degrees  </h3>

The program plans to offer dual degrees (more text to come)

<h2 id="___sec5">Description of learning outcomes </h2>

<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

<p>
The learning outcomes are subdivided in three general categories, knowledge, skills and general competence.

<h2 id="___sec6">Admission criteria: Applied Mathematics and Risk Analysis  </h2>

<li> An average mark C (European grading scale) is required for the above courses.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="___sec7">Study abroad and international collaborators </h2>

<p>
Students at the University of Oslo may choose to <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/" target="_blank">take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad</a>.
The University of Oslo has exchange agreements with other universities in different parts of the world. <a href="http://www.uio.no/studier/utveksling/avtaler/avtaleeiere/uio/" target="_blank">The MN Faculty has additional exchange agreements with many universities abroad</a>.

<p>
Students in this program have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with: <b>add text</b>

<h2 id="___sec8">Career prospects </h2>

<p>
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

<p>
Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

<p>
The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
