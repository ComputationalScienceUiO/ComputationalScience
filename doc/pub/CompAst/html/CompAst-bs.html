<h2 id="___sec0" class="anchor">Why  Astrophysics </h2>

<p>
Roughly speaking, astrophysics is the study of anything and everything
outside the Earth's domain, including the Moon, the Planets,
interplanetary space and the Solar Wind, the Sun, the stars, the Milky
Way, Galaxies, Galaxy Clusters, and the birth, evolution and structure
of the Universe itself. Astrophysics is a field where there is little
"laboratory" work, instead contact with reality must necessarily go
via various remote sensing methods. This is perhaps the reason that
astrophysicsts were amongst the first to develop numerical techniques
to model quite complicated systems and to use high performance
computers as a laboratory, or test bed, to confront their theories
with observational reality.

<p>
In particular, at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (ITA),
computational science is mainly concentrated on three subjects:
solar atmospheric modeling, extragalactic studies, and the evolution
of structure in the Universe.

<h2 id="___sec1" class="anchor">Solar Physics </h2>

<p>
Sufficiently stable to nurture life during the last 4 billion years,
and modern humans the last 100,000 years,  the Sun is nevertheless a
variable star. While the total solar irradiance only varies of order
0.1% during the 11-year solar cycle, the high-energy portion of the
solar output can vary by several orders of magnitude on timescales of
minutes. Solar activity - sun spots and active regions, UV and X-ray
emission, the million degree corona, flares, coronal mass ejections,
the acceleration of energetic particles - is increasingly interfering
with human activity as our society&#8217;s dependence on sensitive
electronic equipment grows and as we venture beyond the Earth&#8217;s
magnetosphere and into the solar system proper. 
There is thus a pressing need to understand the workings of the
energetic Sun.

<p>
At the ITA we have a goal of solving the problems of understanding and
explaining the active sun. This means that we wish to build numerical models of the
solar atmosphere good enough that we can construct synthetic
spectral lines and images that can be directly compared with the observations. We have
access to the best observables; members of the solar group
at the ITA are Co Investigators on ESA's SOHO mission, NASA's IRIS and
SDO missions, and JAXA's Hinode mission, as well as having 42 days of
observing time at the worlds premier solar telescope, the Swedish 1-meter
Solar Telescope on La Palma (Canary Island). To model the Sun we have
constructed the Bifrost code, currently the worlds most advanced code
for modeling the solar chromosphere and corona, and a code that we
plan to expand to incorporate more advanced physics such as
Generalized Ohm's Law, Multi-Fluid dynamics, and particle effects on
relevant subregions. This set of tools gives us a fighting chance of
solving the puzzles that confront us, but also the chance of involving
our students in exciting work at the forefront of science with a
mix of observational, theoretical, and/or numerical tasks.

<h2 id="___sec2" class="anchor">Extragalactic astronomy and Cosmology </h2>

<p>
Galaxies are the building blocks of the Universe. Our home Galaxy, the Milky Way, hosts tens of billions of stars like the Sun, and the Universe contains about one to two hundred billions of galaxies. Galaxies come with different varieties, some with grand design spiral arms like the Milky Way, some with the shape of an ellipsoidal, and still some galaxies look completely irregular. Virtually all large galaxies (including the Milky Way) harbour supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centre. The vast space between galaxies are filled with gaseous intergalactic medium. Following the underlying dark matter structure, the gas accretes onto galaxies, and fuels the star formation and black hole growth within them. In turn, the stars and supermassive black holes inject energy, momentum, radiation and metals (elements with atomic number larger than Helium) into the surrounding gas which impact the subsequent accretion and star formation.  When and how did the first galaxy form from the initial quantum perturbations? How do galaxies evolve throughout the cosmic history? What causes the galaxy population to be so diversified? And how do supermassive black holes form and co-evolve with the host galaxies? How did the radiation from first stars and black holes transform the intergalactic gas?  These are some of the central questions we want to address in modern cosmology.

<p>
Simulating such complex and non-linear systems numerically is a highly challenging task, one needs to not only cover a large dynamic range, but also model simultaneously many physical processes (gravity, hydrodynamics, turbulence, star formation, black hole formation,  radiation, magnetic field and perhaps cosmic rays etc.).  At the ITA, we simulate cosmological galaxy formation with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic codes and sophisticated models of physical processes, including the one that has successfully simulated the world&#8217;s first realistic Milky Way-like galaxy. We also developed a world-leading radiative transfer code to produce synthetic observations to confront simulations with the data. We have local expertise on observations of high-redshift galaxies using first-rate gravitational lensing data from the large Sloan Giant Arc Survey and the future Euclid satellite, as well as multi-wavelength data from major ground-based and space telescopes like HST, Keck, ALMA, GAIA and the upcoming JWST on galaxies at both early Universe and current epoch. It is the golden age for cosmology and extragalactic astronomy and students will be involved in exciting and fruitful projects at the ITA.

<h2 id="___sec3" class="anchor">OK, sounds like fun, but is it actually possible to get a job with a degree in astrophysics? </h2>

<p>
Successful astrophysics students have learned a large variety
techniques to attack abstract problems. These are skills that have
applications far outside of the study of "stars". To give you a taste
of possible careers we have compiled a set of interviews of our
alumni where they explain the relevance of their educations to  
 <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/astro/studier/karriere/index.html" target="_self">their careers.</a>

<p>
This  program is very flexible in its structure and students may opt for starting with their thesis
work from the first semester and scatter the respective course load across all four semesters.
Depending on interests and specializations, there are many courses on computational science which can make
up the required curriculum of course work. Furthermore, courses may be broken up in smaller modules,
avoding thereby the limitation of 10 ECTS per course only. Some of these courses are listed below.

<h3 id="___sec5" class="anchor">Courses </h3>

Depending on specialization, the following courses that can be included as part of the compulsory 60 ECTS needed for a Master of Science degree are <a href="https://computationalscienceuio.github.io/ComputationalScience/doc/pub/ProgramStructure/html/ProgramStructure-bs.html" target="_self">described here</a>.

<h3 id="___sec6" class="anchor">Graduate Certificates  </h3>

The program plans to offer graduate certificates in

<ul>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-MATH  gives a certificate in Computational Mathematics</li>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-PHYS gives a certificate in Computational Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Materials Science  and Geoscience</li>
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-BIO gives a certificate in Computational life science.</li> 
<li> Three of the courses with label CS-INF gives a certificate in High-performance computing.</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id="___sec7" class="anchor">Dual Degrees  </h3>

The program plans to offer dual degrees (more text to come)

<h2 id="___sec8" class="anchor">Description of learning outcomes </h2>

<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.

<p>
Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.

<h2 id="___sec11" class="anchor">Career prospects </h2>

<p>
Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the labor market.

<p>
Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives an
excellent background for further studies, with a PhD as one possible
goal.

<p>
The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
